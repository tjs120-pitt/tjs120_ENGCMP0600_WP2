# How to Solder

 
Soldering is a method of joining electrical components that uses low melting tempurature metals to hold the connection like a glue. 

# Required gear
- soldering iron
- solder
- soldering sponge (for cleaning the iron)
- wire strippers/cutters

## Step 1: identify what kind of solder you will use
Lead Vs. lead-free solder: solder that contains lead generally flows better, makes better connections, and is easier to work with, however if there are any concerns about lead intake lead-free solder still works fine

Solder Diameter: The thickness of the solder you are using is largely personal preferance, but beginners may want to start with a reletivley small diameter to avoid adding to much solder to a joint

Rosin: Generally rosin core solder is recommended, as is removes the extra step of having to add rosing to the connection that is being soldered
-rosin is a chemical that assists in the melting of the solder


## Step 2: Turning on your Iron
(The soldering iron is the pen shaped heading element that is used to heat the connections/solder.)
- ensure that the iron is in its holder and not touching any flamable or heat sensitive materials prior to turning it on
- Turn on the iron
- Set the irons tempurature (below are recomended tempureatures, but these can be deviated from)
-- for leaded solder use a temp around 600 degrees fahrenheit
-- for lead free use a temp around 650 degrees fahrenheit
- While your waiting for the iron to heat up is a good time to wet the sponge that came with your soldering iron
-- This sponge will be used throughout the process of soldering to clean the iron 


## Step 3:Holding the Iron
When grabbing the iron ensure that you hold it by its grip and never touch the metal portion as it will burn you. Whenever you go to put the iron back down ensure that it is placed in its holder to prevent it from burning anything
-- (tip) it can be good to clean the iron priror to any time it is placed in the holder, just to keep on top of cleaning



## Step 4:Sstriping the wires you are connectingh 
THIS STEP IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLDER WIRES
Determine the gauge of wire that you are using and how much of it you would like to strip the outer plastic off of. (Generally you should strip about a quarter inch more wire than you want to solder). Place the section of wire you want stripeed in the circle of the wire strippers that matches the gage of your wire. Close the strippers and pull to yank off the wire coating

## Step 5: Tinning
In order to help with the adhesion of the solder both the iron and the wires should be "tinned". To tin these is to melt a very small amount of solder on each component to create a thin coating of the solder.

## Step 6: Soldering 
- Begin by touching the two components that you want to join together (clamping these in place touching can be very helpful). 
- Apply the soldering iron to heat up the wires
- Apply the solder to the wires (it is best practice to apply the solder directly to the wires that the iron is activly heating rather than touching the solder to the iron itself)
- when the proper amount of solder has been applied remove the iron while still holding the wires in place. The solder will solidify in just a second or two
- If you wish the joint can be tested by pulling on the connection

## Step 7: insulating
Apply electrical tape or heat shring to any exposed wire and then you should be done with that joint
